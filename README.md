# Password-Generator

The password generator here utilizes the bootstrap framework for a responsive page as well as an external style sheet. The user will click the "generate password" button to trigger the entire password generating function. When the user is prompted to select the number of characters and which kind of characters to use they are limited to using between 8-128 characters and at least one character type (otherwise the function alerts the user and refreshes the page, thus forcing the user to start over). Once an appropriate input is provided by the user, a conditional statement is used to determine sort through the characters array and "slice" out the appropriate one to use. This conditional is nested within a for loop which runs until the users desired number of characters have been selected. Each individual selection from the array is then reassembled into a new array which then appears on the users screen.
